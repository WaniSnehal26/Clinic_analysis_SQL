## Introduction

In this project, we analyze a clinic's database using SQL queries. The purpose is to extract meaningful insights from the data to aid in decision-making, resource allocation, and improving clinic operations. This README provides an overview of the database schema, the queries used for analysis, and some key findings.

## Database Schema

The clinic database consists of one table, representing different aspects of clinic operations. Here is an overview of the main tables in the database:

- `date`
- `waiting_time`
- `Visit_time`, etc

## Queries

The SQL queries in this project are designed to retrieve specific information from the database and perform analysis. Some common types of queries include:

- Basic SELECT queries to retrieve patient demographics and appointment details.
- Aggregate queries to calculate statistics such as average appointment duration, patient wait times, etc.
- UPDATE, ALTER

## Analysis

The analysis section presents key findings and insights obtained from running the SQL queries on the clinic database. It may include trends, patterns, anomalies, and recommendations based on the data analysis.

## Usage

To use this project, you need access to the excel file and a SQL text file.
