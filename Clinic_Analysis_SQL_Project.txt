        when patient_age >= 41 and patient_age <= 50 then '41-50'
        when patient_age >= 51 and patient_age <= 60 then '51-60'
        else '60+'
    end;
    
14) age group wise patient count

select patient_age as age_group, count(patient_id) as patient_count from 
hospitaler
group by patient_age;


15) concating name columns to get full name of patients

alter table hospitaler
add column full_name varchar(10);

update hospitaler
set full_name = concat(patient_first_inital, ' ' , patient_last_name);

16) patient count race wise 

select patient_race as race, count(patient_id) as patient_count
from hospitaler
group by patient_race
order by patient_count desc;

17) changed the waiting time column's datatype to create group of time

alter table hospitaler
modify column patient_waittime varchar(10);


18) groups for waiting time 

update hospitaler
set patient_waittime = case 
                           when patient_waittime >= 10 and 
patient_waittime <= 30 then '10-30 mins'
                           when patient_waittime >= 31 and 
patient_waittime <= 50 then '31-50 mins'
                           else '50+ mins'
                       end;

19) getting count waiting time wise 

select patient_waittime as waiting_time , count(patient_id) as 
patients_count from hospitaler
group by patient_waittime
order by patients_count desc;

20) updating none with no refferal for better understanding

update hospitaler
set department_referral = case 
                            when department_referral = 'none' then 'no 
refferal'
                            else department_referral
                          end;


21) refferal wise patient count


select department_referral as refferral, count(patient_id) as counts
from hospitaler
group by refferral
order by counts desc;


22) updating time column(replacing 0 with 24 for better understanging)

update hospitaler
set time_col = case 
                    when time_col = 0 then 24
                    else time_col
               end;

23)  altering table for time column

alter table hospitaler
modify column time_col varchar(10);


24) creating time slots to check patients visit timing

update hospitaler 
set time_col = case 
                   when time_col >= 1 and time_col <= 5 then '1-5'
                   when time_col >= 6 and time_col <= 10 then '6-10'
                   when time_col >= 11 and time_col <= 15 then '11-15'
                   when time_col >= 16 and time_col <= 20 then '16-20'
                   when time_col >= 21 and time_col <= 24 then '21-24'
               end;

25) checking patients count in each time slot 

select time_col as time_slot , count(patient_id) as patient_count 
from hospitaler
group by time_slot 
order by patient_count desc;
